            <h2>Seasoning for chicken breast</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>These chicken burgers are made with crispy seasoned chicken breast fillets. I just halve chicken breasts to create two thin steaks – or you can buy chicken breast already cut into steaks at the store.</li>
                <li>Coat in a seasoned flour (the flour makes it nice and crispy), pan fry until golden then top with cheese to melt.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, that the burger buns or bread rolls and prepare your toppings! I like to fry up some onion because a burger doesn’t feel like a burger without onions.</li>
                <li>But the beauty of burgers is that you can load it up with your toppings of choice. Lettuce, tomato, pickles, beetroot, avocado, bacon, egg. Go wild!</li>
                <li>Nothing whizz bang about these Chicken Burgers, but they are a tasty staple recipe. The main thing is the seasoning for the chicken – I personally think it’s important to load up the chicken with plenty of flavour, especially if you only use one thinnish piece like I do (for a greater surface area to flesh ratio and no marinating).</li>
                <li>I use avocado in this burger which adds creaminess and takes the place of a 2nd sauce / mustard that I would otherwise use. I’ve added some tips in the notes for alternative condiments that I think go great with chicken burgers.

            <h2>What you need for a great cheeseburger</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span>The beef:</span> No need to get (too) snobby</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>For company:</span> 50/50 brisket and chuck with 20% fat, ground to order by the butcher. Brisket brings really good beefy flavour, and chuck for texture.</li>
                    <li><span>For the everyday:</span> Standard beef mince from the grocery store still makes a great burger. Mince can be a mixture of any cuts and offcuts but is usually predominantly chuck. Fattier mince = juicy and more flavourful. Leaner mince = still fine but not as juicy. </li>
                    <li><span>Single vs double cheeseburger:</span> The decision is entirely up to you. I use 150g / 5 oz per patty for a 10cm / 4″ wide bun, so just double up if you want a double.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The cheese: Processed for authenticity!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the truly classic cheeseburger experience, we need processed cheese. Nothing oozes, stretches and runs the way proper, luridly orange processed American cheese does when it melts. Natural be damned – we’re in this for the nostalgia and the authenticity!</li>
                </ul>
                <li><span>The bun:</span> Soft and white</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Soft white buns, preferably with sesame seeds, are in my opinion the only way to go. Soft is essential so it becomes one with everything jammed inside. There is a time and place for crusty artisan breads, but now is not it!</li>
                <li>There is also a time for wholemeal breads, seeded breads and olive studded breads – but again, now is not the time! </li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>The green stuff and pickled stuff</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span>Lettuce –</span> Cos/romaine and shredded iceberg lettuce are about as classic as you can get with burgers. If you want to get gourmet with baby greens, rocket/arugula, spinach or even kale, </li>
                    <li><span>Onion –</span> Raw red onion rings are my onion of choice. I like the bite and freshness they bring as a foil to all the fatty beefiness of the burger. For those who find them too harsh, alternatives are to dice them then scatter just a bit on your burger, or cook ordinary (not red) onions instead</li>
                    <li><span>Tomato –</span> As with the onion, tomato brings moisture and a touch of welcome freshness to this stack of goodness.</li>
                    <li><span>Pickles (BIG!) –</span> Opt for big gherkins rather than small ones, else you’ll end up with a burger scattered with dozens of tiny little gherkin rounds! And that ain’t cool.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>The sauce</li>
                   <ul>
                    <li>And last but not least, the sauces. You can absolutely stick to the tried-and-true ketchup / mustard script. But today, I’m also sharing two homemade burger sauces:</li>
                      <ol>
                        <li><span>Special Burger Sauce –</span> An orange-hued, mayonnaise-based sauce that’s a blatant copycat of a popular burger sauce sold at grocery stores; </li>
                        <li><span>Tomato Burger Sauce –</span> Essentially a quick tomato chutney. But it has a more savoury flavour which I think suits burgers better than traditional chutney which is traditionally quite sweet and flavoured with distracting things like ginger, chilli and cardamom.</li>
                      </ol>
                   </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Cooking</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bake the beans and vegetables to dry them out slightly. This serves three purposes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>removing excess water to eliminate the soggy patty issue</li>
                    <li>improving the burger texture</li>
                    <li>intensifying flavour.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>For the vegetables, I use mushrooms and carrots.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mushrooms add great savoury flavour and add to the “meatiness” of the patty;</li>
                    <li>Carrots – I use carrots because it’s a low water content veg plus I like that it adds little bits of colour to the burger.</li>

                </ul>
                  <li>As for the beans, I use cannellini beans mainly for colour purposes. Other beans will work just fine – I’ve made this with red kidney beans, black beans, butter beans and chickpeas.</li>
                  <li>When you pull them out of the oven, they will look thoroughly unappetising. Wrinkled and dry. And that’s exactly what you want!!!</li>
